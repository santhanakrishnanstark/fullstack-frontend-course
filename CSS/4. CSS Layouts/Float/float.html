                The Australian boobook (Ninox boobook) is an owl native to
                mainland Australia, southern New Guinea, the island of Timor,
                and the Sunda Islands. Described by John Latham in 1801, its
                name is derived from its two-tone boo-book call. Eight
                subspecies are recognised; three further subspecies were
                reclassified as separate species in 2019. The smallest owl on
                the Australian mainland, the boobook is 27 to 36 cm (10.5 to 14
                in) long, with predominantly dark-brown plumage and prominent
                pale spots. It has grey-green or yellow-green eyes. It is
                generally nocturnal, though it is sometimes active at dawn and
                dusk, retiring to roost in secluded spots in the foliage of
                trees. The Australian boobook feeds on insects and small
                vertebrates, hunting by pouncing on them from tree perches.
                Breeding takes place from late winter to early summer, and tree
                hollows are used as nesting sites. The species has a large range
                and apparently stable population, and is not threatened.
