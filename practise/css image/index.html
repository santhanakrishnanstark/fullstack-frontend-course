                     A  CSS  comprises  of  style  rules  that  are  interpreted  by  the  browser  and  then 
                    applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of 
                    three parts: 
                     Selector: A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This 
                    could be any tag like h1 or table etc. 
                     Property: A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the 
                    HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could 
                    be color, border, etc. 
                     Value: Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can 
                    have the value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.

                    CSS Rules Overriding 
                    We have discussed four ways to include style sheet rules in an HTML document. 
                    Here is the rule to override any Style Sheet Rule. 
                     Any  inline  style  sheet  takes  the  highest  priority.  So,  it  will  override  any 
                    rule  defined  in    tags  or  the  rules  defined  in  any 
                    external style sheet file. 
                     Any rule defined in  tags will override the rules defined 
                    in any external style sheet file. 
                     Any rule defined in the external style sheet file takes  the  lowest priority, 
                    and the rules defined in this file will be applied only when the above two 
                    rules are not applicable. 
                </p>

                    What are Pseudo-classes?

                    A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
                    
                    For example, it can be used to:
                    
                        Style an element when a user mouses over it
                        Style visited and unvisited links differently
                        Style an element when it gets focus
