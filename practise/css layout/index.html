          <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
          <p>
            What is CSS?
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

          <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
          <p>
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
          </p>

          <p>
            Example Explained
            p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
            color is a property, and red is the property value
            text-align is a property, and center is the property value

          <h3>ways of inserting a style sheet</h3>
          <p>
            There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
            External CSS
            Internal CSS
            Inline CSS
            What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
            All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
            Inline style (inside an HTML element)
            External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
            Browser default
            So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

          <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
          <p>
             Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
